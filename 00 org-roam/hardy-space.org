#+TITLE: Hardy space
#+FILETAGS: object
Hardy space is the space of all functions on $L^2$ which have
the Fourier series $\Sigma_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n e^{i\theta}$.
It is defined like so:

Take $L^2 = L^2(\mathbb{T}, \sigma)$ where $\mathbb{T}$ is
the unit circle and $\sigma$ the measure of normalised length.
Then the space $H^2$ is defined as the span of all monomials:
$H^2 = span\{I, z, z^2, z^3, ...\}$
