A 'prior method' of estimating the [[id:b6c07176-104f-474f-a4d3-b34607ad64fd][Spectrum]] $\sigma(A)$
involves proving that for a particular increasing sequence
of subspaces $\mathcal{L}_n$, the spectrum of the [[id:741d9935-e753-46ff-ba5a-490e16bbf854][Truncations]]
$A_{\mathcal{L}_n}$ converges to the spectrum of $A$, with
an explicit error bound or information on the rate of convergence.

The proofs are often very difficult and assume specific conditions,
and have very large error bounds.

* Posterior method of eigenvalue estimation

A 'posterior method' of estimating an operator's [[id:b6c07176-104f-474f-a4d3-b34607ad64fd][Spectrum]] is
to choose a subspace $\mathcal{L}$ and use computation to obtain
rigorous bounds on the location of $\sigma(A)$. There is no prior
guarantee that useful bounds will be obtained, but these methods
are very popular.
