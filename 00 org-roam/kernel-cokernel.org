* Kernel
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f5821040-369c-40d9-a662-e2f6d54cd586
:END:
The kernel $kerA$ of a bounded operator $A$ on $E$ with closed range is the set
$kerA = \{x \in E\ : Ax = 0}

* Cokernel
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8a0a1de4-6ac7-4f9a-913e-c623dcaf87df
:END:
The cokernel $cokerA$ of a bounded operator $A$ on $E$ with closed range is the quotient algebra
$cokerA = E / AE$
