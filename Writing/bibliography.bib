One might think, in the spirit of Mercier-Osborn-Rappaz-Raviart and in consideration of the good behavior of commonly used mixed elements (like Raviart-Thomas or Brezzi-Douglas-Marini elements), that these conditions are also sufficient to ensure good convergence properties for eigenvalues. In this paper we show that this is not the case. In particular we present examples of mixed finite element approximations that satisfy the above properties but exhibit spurious eigenvalues. Such bad behavior is proved analytically and demonstrated in numerical experiments. We also present additional assumptions (fulfilled by the commonly used mixed methods already mentioned) which guarantee optimal error bounds for eigenvalue approximations as well.},

It assumes that the reader has a knowledge of introductory functional analysis, up to the spectral theorem for bounded linear operators on Banach spaces. However, it describes the theory of Fourier transforms and distributions as far as is needed to analyse the spectrum of any constant coefficient partial differential operator. A completely new proof of the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators is followed by its application to a variety of second-order elliptic differential operators, from those with discrete spectrum to Schr{\"o}dinger operators acting on L2(RN). The book contains a detailed account of the application of variational methods to estimate the eigenvalues of operators with measurable coefficients defined by the use of quadratic form techniques. This book could be used either for self-study or as a course text, and aims to lead the reader to the more advanced literature on the subject.},

These methods are reliable because the iterative computation of the nodes has guaranteed convergence, and they are fast due to their fourth-order convergence and its asymptotic exactness for an appropriate selection of the variables. For Gauss--Hermite and Gauss--Laguerre quadratures, local Taylor series can be used for computing efficiently the orthogonal polynomials involved, with exact initial values for the Hermite case and first values computed with a continued fraction for the Laguerre case. The resulting algorithms have almost unrestricted validity with respect to the parameters. Full relative precision is reached for the Hermite nodes, without any accuracy loss and for any degree, and a mild accuracy loss occurs for the Hermite and Laguerre weights as well as for the Laguerre nodes. These fast methods are exclusively based on convergent processes, which, together with the high order of convergence of the underlying iterative method, makes them particularly useful for high accuracy computations. We show examples of very high accuracy computations (of up to 1000 digits of accuracy).},

In doing so, it is important to understand the influence of the linearization process on the accuracy and stability of the computed solution. We discuss these issues for three particular linearizations: the standard companion linearization and two linearizations that preserve symmetry in the problem. For illustration we employ a model QEP describing the motion of a beam simply supported at both ends and damped at the midpoint. We show that the above linearizations lead to poor numerical results for the beam problem, but that a two-parameter scaling proposed by Fan, Lin and Van Dooren cures the instabilities. We also show that half of the eigenvalues of the beam QEP are pure imaginary and are eigenvalues of the undamped problem. Our analysis makes use of recently developed theory explaining the sensitivity and stability of linearizations, the main conclusions of which are summarized. As well as arguing that scaling should routinely be used, we give guidance on how to choose a linearization and illustrate the practical value of condition numbers and backward errors.

  abstract = {An effective single-band Hamiltonian representing a crystal electron in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding form of a Bloch band by replacing ℏ{$\rightarrow$}k by the operator {$\rightarrow$}p-e{$\rightarrow$}Ac. The resultant Schr{\"o}dinger equation becomes a finite-difference equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum. The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of "rational" fields is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an "irrational" field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features, it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies. It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new type of magnetic "superlattice" is introduced, constructed so that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites. Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model, whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions experimentally is sketched., This article appears in the following collection:},

In two example problems, we show that when system stability is analyzed numerically using \{{\textbackslash}em descriptor\} notation, spurious eigenvalues are eliminated. Descriptor notation is a generalized eigenvalue formulation for differential-algebraic equations that explicitly retains algebraic constraints. We propose that spurious eigenvalues are likely to occur when algebraic constraints are used to analytically reduce the number of independent variables in a differential-algebraic system of equations before the system is approximated numerically. In contrast, the simple and easily generalizable descriptor framework simultaneously solves the differential equations and algebraic constraints and is well-suited to stability analysis in these systems.},

Our proofs are based on a new approach to the nesting set analysis for Neumann to Dirichlet maps first proposed by Amrein and Pearson in 2004, with enhanced convergence results obtained from an elliptic regularity bootstrapping procedure. The numerical results in Section 6 illustrate a technique for finding eigenvalues in spectral gaps of self-adjoint operators by means of a compactly supported complex shift.

  abstract = {Periodic boundary conditions enable fast density-functional-based calculations for defects and their complexes in semiconductors. Such calculations are popular methods to estimate defect energetics, structural parameters, vibrational modes and other physical characteristics. However, the periodicity introduces spurious defect--defect interactions and dispersion of the defect-induced electronic states. For charged defects, compensating background charging has to be introduced to avoid electrostatic divergences. These factors, together with the intrinsic limitation of standard density-functional theory for accurate estimation of semiconducting gaps, pose challenges for quantitatively accurate and properly controlled calculations. This chapter discusses these issues, including point sampling, electrostatic (Madelung) corrections, valence-band (reference energy) alignment, and other finite-size effects in supercell calculations. These are important for reliable estimation of formation and migration energies as well as ionization-level prediction. Moreover, the chapter discusses the various ways of generating transferable pseudopotentials, the choice of the exchange-correlation functional, and other topics related to total-energy calculations. Methods to calculate excitation energies and other spectroscopic properties as well as atomic motions are also discussed. Examples of applications of the supercell methods to a few selected semiconductor defects are presented.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, we study the spectrum of Schr{\"o}dinger operators with complex potentials and Dirichlet Laplace operators on domains with rough boundaries. The focus is on spectral approximation results and a-priori bounds for the location and distribution of eigenvalues. Chapter 1 provides an overview of our main results and Chapters 2 - 5 are based on the papers [130, 129, 79, 121] respectively. In Chapter 2, spectral inclusion and pollution results are proved for sequences of linear operators of the form T0+i{$\gamma$}sn on a Hilbert space, where sn is strongly convergent to the identity operator and {$\gamma$} {$>$} 0. We work in both an abstract setting and a more concrete Sturm-Liouville framework. The results provide rigorous justification for a method of computing eigenvalues in spectral gaps. In Chapter 3, we consider Schr{\"o}dinger operators of the form HR = -d 2/dx 2 +q+i{$\gamma\chi$}[0,R] for large R {$>$} 0, where q {$\in$} L 1 (0,{$\infty$}) and {$\gamma$} {$>$} 0. Bounds for the maximum magnitude of an eigenvalue and for the number of eigenvalues are proved. These bounds complement existing general bounds applied to this operator, for sufficiently large R. In Chapter 4, we prove upper and lower bounds for sums of eigenvalues of Lieb-- Thirring type for non-self-adjoint Schr{\"o}dinger operators on the half-line. The upper bounds are established for general classes of integrable potentials and are shown to be optimal in various senses by proving the lower bounds for specific potentials. We consider sums that correspond to both the critical and non-critical cases. In Chapter 5, we prove a Mosco convergence theorem for H 1 0 spaces of bounded Euclidean domains satisfying a set of mild geometric hypotheses. For bounded domains, this notion implies norm-resolvent convergence for the Dirichlet Laplacian which in turn ensures spectral convergence. A key element of the proof is the development of a novel, explicit Poincar{\'e}-type inequality. These results allow us to construct a universal algorithm capable of computing the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on a wide class of rough domains. Many domains with fractal boundaries, such as the Koch snowflake and certain filled Julia sets, are included among this class. Conversely, we construct a counter example showing that there does not exist a universal algorithm of the same type capable of computing the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on an arbitrary bounded domain.},

  abstract = {Numerical analysis provides the theoretical foundation for the numerical algorithms we rely on to solve a multitude of computational problems in science. Based on a successful course at Oxford University, this book covers a wide range of such problems ranging from the approximation of functions and integrals to the approximate solution of algebraic, transcendental, differential and integral equations. Throughout the book, particular attention is paid to the essential qualities of a numerical algorithm - stability, accuracy, reliability and efficiency. The authors go further than simply providing recipes for solving computational problems. They carefully analyse the reasons why methods might fail to give accurate answers, or why one method might return an answer in seconds while another would take billions of years. This book is ideal as a text for students in the second year of a university mathematics course. It combines practicality regarding applications with consistently high standards of rigour.},

  year = {1975},
  publisher = {American Mathematical Society},
  abstract = {The general theory of orthogonal polynomials was developed in the late 19th century from a study of continued fractions by P. L. Chebyshev, even though special cases were introduced earlier by Legendre, Hermite, Jacobi, Laguerre, and Chebyshev himself. It was further developed by A. A. Markov, T. J. Stieltjes, and many other mathematicians. The book by Szego, originally published in 1939, is the first monograph devoted to the theory of orthogonal polynomials and its applications in many areas, including analysis, differential equations, probability and mathematical physics. Even after all the years that have passed since the book first appeared, and with many other books on the subject published since then, this classic monograph by Szego remains an indispensable resource both as a textbook and as a reference book. It can be recommended to anyone who wants to be acquainted with this central topic of mathematical analysis.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanics and the theory of operators on Hilbert space have been deeply linked since their beginnings in the early twentieth century. States of a quantum system correspond to certain elements of the configuration space and observables correspond to certain operators on the space. This book is a brief, but self-contained, introduction to the mathematical methods of quantum mechanics, with a view towards applications to Schrodinger operators. Part 1 of the book is a concise introduction to the spectral theory of unbounded operators. Only those topics that will be needed for later applications are covered. The spectral theorem is a central topic in this approach and is introduced at an early stage. Part 2 starts with the free Schrodinger equation and computes the free resolvent and time evolution. Position, momentum, and angular momentum are discussed via algebraic methods. Various mathematical methods are developed, which are then used to compute the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Further topics include the nondegeneracy of the ground state, spectra of atoms, and scattering theory. This book serves as a self-contained introduction to spectral theory of unbounded operators in Hilbert space with full proofs and minimal prerequisites: Only a solid knowledge of advanced calculus and a one-semester introduction to complex analysis are required. In particular, no functional analysis and no Lebesgue integration theory are assumed. It develops the mathematical tools necessary to prove some key results in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Mathematical Methods in Quantum Mechanics is intended for beginning graduate students in both mathematics and physics and provides a solid foundation for reading more advanced books and current research literature. It is well suited for self-study and includes numerous exercises (many with hints).},
