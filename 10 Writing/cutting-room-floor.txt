One can see that this concept generalises the eigenvalues of a matrix to any Banach space, and that for a finite-dimensional Banach space
(of which $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$ are major examples) we can recover the eigenvector equation. Indeed, the term `resolvent'
originates from its relation to the solution of certain types of differential equation; if for some differential operator $L$ we have the equation
$Lu = \lambda u + g$, a solution $u$ would be related to $g$ as $(L - \lambda)^{-1}g = u$. 

For an operator on an
infinite-dimensional space, values which satisfy the eigenvector equation \emph{are} in the spectrum of the operator, but they do not
comprise the entire spectrum - nor do we necessarily have a spectrum made up of a discrete set of values.

\begin{example}
Let $S$ be the 'right-shift' operator on the sequence space $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$, which has the following action:
$S(x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)$ = $(0, x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)$; that is, for a sequence $u$ we map $u_n$ to $u_{n+1}$, and pad the vector with a zero in $u_1$'s place.
$S$ has no eigenvalues, and its spectrum is the open unit disc $D = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| = 1\}$.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}{\emph{(sketch)}}
For the lack of eigenvalues; we see that if $Su = \lambda u$, 
$$(0, u_1, u_2, u_3 ...) = (\lambda u_1, \lambda u_2, \lambda u_3 ...)$$
so in particular, we would require $\lambda u_1 = 0$. Then either $\lambda = 0$ and thus $u_n$ = 0 for all $n$, or as $\lambda \neq 0$, $u_1 =0$. Then $\lambda u_2 = u_1 = 0$, and continuing this we
can see that $u_n = 0$ for all $n$, i.e. $u$ must be the zero vector. Thus there is no non-zero vector satisfying the eigenvector equation.

To calculate its spectrum, we make use of a natural relation between the spectrum of an operator T and the spectrum of its adjoint: 
\begin{align*}
\lambda \in \Spec(T)  &\text{ iff } (T - \lambda)\text{ is not invertible }\\
& \text{ iff } (T - \lambda)^*\text{ is not invertible (this is true for any operator)}\\
& = (T^* - \overline{\lambda}) \text{ not invertible, i.e. } \overline{\lambda} \in \Spec(T^*).
\end{align*}
in this case, the adjoint is the left-shift operator $S^*u = (u_2, u_3, u_4, ...).$; we can see that for any value $\lambda$ we have for the vector
$(\lambda, \lambda^2, \lambda^3...)$
$$S^*(\lambda, \lambda^2, \lambda^3) = (\lambda^2, \lambda^3, \lambda^4, ...) = \lambda(\lambda, \lambda^2, \lambda^3...)$$
which is in $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ and is thus an eigenvector iff $|\lambda| < 1$; hence the unit disc is in $\Spec(S^*)$ and hence its
complex conjugate (which is also the unit disc) is in $\Spec(S)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}
We know from Proposition \ref{thm:num-range-props} that $\Spec(T) \subseteq \overline{\Num(T)} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and so $\inf(\Spec(T)) \geq \inf(\Num(T))$. Let $\inf(\Num(T)) = w_0$; then $((T - w_0)u, u) = (Tu, u) - w_0 \geq 0$, and so $u, v \mapsto ((T - w_0)u, v)$ defines a positive-semidefinite Hermitian form, for which the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds\footnote{This can easily be verified by looking at a standard proof of the inequality!}. Denote this form $\tau [u, v]$. For $u, v$ with $\|u\| = \|v\| = 1$, we have
\begin{align*}
|\tau[u,v]|^2 \leq \tau[u, u] \tau[v, v] = ((T - w_0)u, u)((T - w_0)v, v) \leq \|T - w_0\|((T - w_0)u, u)
\end{align*}
Now let us take a minimising sequence $u_n$, $\|u_n\| = 1$ such that $(Tu_n, u_n) \rightarrow w_0$. Then we have
\begin{align*}
\|(T - w_0)u_n\|^2 = |\tau[u_n, (T - w_0)u_n]|^2  \leq \|T - w_0\|((T - w_0)u_n, u_n) \leq \|T - w_0\||(Tu_n, u_n) - w_0| \rightarrow 0,
\end{align*}
and therefore $w_0 \in \Spec(T)$ by Theorem \ref{thm:approx-eigenvalue-thm}.
The proof for the supremum $w_1$ is analogous, using $((w_1 - T)u, u) = w_1 - (Tu, u) \geq 0$.
\end{proof}
