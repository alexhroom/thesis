Such operators are encountered in the modeling of the electronic structure of crystals with local defects and of photonic crystals. The usual finite element Galerkin approximation is known to give rise to spectral pollution. In this article, we give a precise description of the corresponding spurious states. We then prove that the supercell model does not produce spectral pollution. Finally, we extend results by Lewin and S{\'e}r{\'e} on some no-pollution criteria. In particular, we prove that using approximate spectral projectors enables one to eliminate spectral pollution in a given spectral gap of the reference periodic Schr{\"o}dinger operator.

It assumes that the reader has a knowledge of introductory functional analysis, up to the spectral theorem for bounded linear operators on Banach spaces. However, it describes the theory of Fourier transforms and distributions as far as is needed to analyse the spectrum of any constant coefficient partial differential operator. A completely new proof of the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators is followed by its application to a variety of second-order elliptic differential operators, from those with discrete spectrum to Schr{\"o}dinger operators acting on L2(RN). The book contains a detailed account of the application of variational methods to estimate the eigenvalues of operators with measurable coefficients defined by the use of quadratic form techniques. This book could be used either for self-study or as a course text, and aims to lead the reader to the more advanced literature on the subject.},

It offers a comprehensive survey of modern techniques in the theoretical study of PDE with particular emphasis on nonlinear equations. Its wide scope and clear exposition make it a great text for a graduate course in PDE. For this edition, the author has made numerous changes, including a new chapter on nonlinear wave equations, more than 80 new exercises, several new sections, a significantly expanded bibliography.  About the First Edition: I have used this book for both regular PDE and topics courses. It has a wonderful combination of insight and technical detail...Evans' book is evidence of his mastering of the field and the clarity of presentation (Luis Caffarelli, University of Texas) It is fun to teach from Evans' book. It explains many of the essential ideas and techniques of partial differential equations ...Every graduate student in analysis should read it. (David Jerison, MIT) I use Partial Differential Equations to prepare my students for their Topic exam, which is a requirement before starting working on their dissertation. The book provides an excellent account of PDE's ...I am very happy with the preparation it provides my students. (Carlos Kenig, University of Chicago) Evans' book has already attained the status of a classic. It is a clear choice for students just learning the subject, as well as for experts who wish to broaden their knowledge ...An outstanding reference for many aspects of the field.

  abstract = {The LR transformation, due to Rutishauser, has proved to be a powerful method for finding the eigenvalues of symmetric band matrices. Little attention, however, has been paid to its application to the more difficult problem of finding eigenvalues of general unsymmetric matrices. If the matrices are large two important difficulties are likely to occur. Firstly, triangular decomposition, which is the basis of the method, is by no means always numerically stable, and secondly, the amount of computation required by the method is likely to be very great. This paper describes an algorithm similar to the LR transformation except that the transformations involved in it are all unitary and can thus be expected to by numerically stable. It is then shown that there are various advantages in first converting the matrix to almost-triangular form; in particular, the amount of work involved in the algorithm can then be greatly reduced.Part 1 of the paper is largely concerned with proof of convergence, and the theoretical aspect. Part 2, to be published in January, discussed practical computation and gives results of experiments.},

This is followed by applications to periodic Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger operators (pollution is absent in a Wannier-type basis), and to Dirac operator (several natural decompositions are considered). In the second part, we add the constraint that within the Galerkin basis there is a certain relation between vectors in \$PH\$ and vectors in \$(1-P)H\$. Abstract results are proved and applied to several practical methods like the famous "kinetic balance" of relativistic Quantum Mechanics.},

In two example problems, we show that when system stability is analyzed numerically using \{{\textbackslash}em descriptor\} notation, spurious eigenvalues are eliminated. Descriptor notation is a generalized eigenvalue formulation for differential-algebraic equations that explicitly retains algebraic constraints. We propose that spurious eigenvalues are likely to occur when algebraic constraints are used to analytically reduce the number of independent variables in a differential-algebraic system of equations before the system is approximated numerically. In contrast, the simple and easily generalizable descriptor framework simultaneously solves the differential equations and algebraic constraints and is well-suited to stability analysis in these systems.},
