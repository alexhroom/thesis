\section{Bounding spectral pollution}

\subsection{The essential spectrum of an operator}
\begin{definition}{\textbf{(Essential spectrum)}}\index{spectrum!essential}
The essential spectrum\footnote{The essential spectrum has several definitions, 
the most popular usually denoted $\Spec_{e,i}$ for $i \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ in order of size. For 
most well-behaved operators the definitions are equivalent. This particular definition 
is Weyl's criterion, $\Spec_{e, 2}$.}\index{Weyl's criterion} of an operator $T$ on a Hilbert space $H$ 
is defined as the set of all $\lambda$ such that a \textbf{Weyl sequence}\index{Weyl sequence} $u_n$ exists for $T$ and $\lambda$ , i.e. a sequence with the properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\|u_n\| = 1\quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$;
\item $u_n \rightharpoonup 0$ (where $\rightharpoonup$ denotes weak convergence: $u_n \rightharpoonup u \Leftrightarrow (u_n, g) \rightarrow (u, g) \quad \forall g \in H$);
\item $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\|(T - \lambda)u_n\|  \rightarrow 0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:ess-in-spec}
If $\lambda$ is in the essential spectrum of $T$, then it is in the spectrum of $T$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $\lambda$ satisfy the criterion in the definition of essential spectrum. Now assume for contradiction that $(T - \lambda)$ is invertible.
%% TODO: finish proof
\end{proof}

We can loosen the definition of weak convergence to just require convergence in a dense subspace of $H$:
\begin{lemma}\label{thm:weak-conv-dense-subset}
A bounded sequence $u_n$, $\|u_n\| \leq C$, is weakly convergent to $u$ in $H$ if and only if it is weakly convergent to $u$ in $L$ where $L$ is a dense subspace of $H$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Weak convergence in $H$ implying the same in $L$ is obvious by the definition. 
Conversely, take $g \in H$. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, we have $\|g - \varphi\| < \varepsilon$ for $\varphi \in L$; furthermore by the weak convergence of $u_n$ in $L$ we have $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $(u_n - u, \varphi) < \varepsilon$ for $n \geq N$. Then:
$$( u_n - u, g ) = ( u_n - u, g - \varphi + \varphi ) = ( u_n - u, g - \varphi ) + ( u_n - u, \varphi ) < \|u_n - u\| \|g - \varphi\| + \varepsilon < \varepsilon(C + 1) \rightarrow 0.$$
\end{proof}

We will now construct a Weyl sequence for the essential spectrum of the 'Laplacian' or 'free Schr\"odinger' operator $T = -\Delta$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$,
where on $\mathbb{R}^1$, $\Delta$ is the operator $\Delta f (x) = \frac{d^2}{dx^2} f(x)$

\begin{proposition}
The essential spectrum of the operator $T = -\Delta$ is the closed half-axis $[0, +\infty)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First, note that for the exponential function we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:laplace-eigenvector}
T(\text{exp})(i\omega x) = \omega^2 \exp(i\omega x).
\end{equation}
This gives much of the intuition for this proof; the function $\exp_{i \omega}: x \mapsto \exp(i\omega x)$ is not an eigenvector 
as it is not in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, but it satisifes the eigenvalue equation for $T$ and so any number $\lambda = \omega^2$ -
and thus any $\lambda \in [0, +\infty)$ - is 'almost' an eigenvalue for $T$.

We take advantage of this by choosing some smooth bump function $\rho \in C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R})$ with $\|\rho\|_2 = 1$. We
then define $\rho_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rho(x/n)$. $\rho_n$ has some nice properties: by a substitution of variables and direct calculation we have $\|\rho_n\|_2 = \|\rho\|_2$, and furthermore any k'th derivative $\rho_n^{(k)}$ of $\rho_n$ 
converges to 0 in $L^2$. Indeed:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rhokn-vanishes}
\|\rho_n^{(k)}\|_2 = \frac{1}{n^k}\|\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rho^{(k)}(x/n)\|_2 = \frac{\|\rho^{(k)}\|_2}{n^k} \rightarrow 0
\end{equation}
where one can see $\|\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rho^{(k)}(x/n)\|_2 = \|\rho^{(k)}\|_2$ by the same calculation as  $\|\rho_n\|_2 = \|\rho\|_2$.

Now, let our candidate Weyl sequence be $u_n: x \mapsto \rho_n(x)\exp(i\omega x)$,
which truncates $\exp(i\omega x)$ to $\supp \rho_n$; this means $u_n$ is in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$.
$\|u_n\| = \|\rho_n\|_2 = \|\rho\|_2 = 1$ by direct calculation, and $u_n \rightharpoonup 0$: we can bound $u_n$ by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} M \1_{(\supp u_n)}$, where $\1_A$ is the characteristic function of the set $A$ and $M$ is the maximum value of $\rho$. Then by Lemma \ref{thm:weak-conv-dense-subset}, we can simply show weak convergence for any $\varphi \in C_0^\infty$, which is dense in $L^2$:
\begin{align*}
( u_n, \varphi ) & = \int_{\mathbb{R}}u_n \varphi & \\
& \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} M \1_{(\supp u_n)} \varphi & \\
& \leq \int_{\supp \varphi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} M  \varphi & \\
& = \frac{M}{\sqrt{n}} \int_{\supp \varphi} \varphi \rightarrow 0, & \text{as the integral of $\varphi$ is finite and independent of $n$.}
\end{align*}
Finally, we show that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\|(T - \lambda)u_n\|_2  \rightarrow 0$ for $\lambda = \omega^2$:

\begin{align*}
\|(T - \lambda)u_n\|_2 & = \|(T(\exp_{i \omega} \rho_n) - \omega^2(\exp_{i \omega} \rho_n)\|_2 & \\
& = \|(T(\exp_{i \omega} \rho_n) - T(\exp_{i \omega}) \rho_n\|_2 & \text{\emph{(by equation (\ref{eqn:laplace-eigenvector}))}} \\
& =\|\exp_{i \omega} T\rho_n - 2 \omega \exp_{i \omega} \frac{d}{dx}\rho_n\|_2 & \text{\emph{(by the product rule)}} \\
& = \|T\rho_n - 2 \omega \frac{d}{dx}\rho_n\|_2 & \text{\emph{(see $\|\exp_{i \omega} \phi\|_2 = \|\phi\|_2$ for any $\phi \in L^2$)}} \\
& \leq  \|-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\rho_n\|_2 + 2\omega\|\frac{d}{dx}\rho_n\|_2 \rightarrow 0, & 
\end{align*}

converging by equation (\ref{eqn:rhokn-vanishes}).
Thus $u_n$ forms a Weyl sequence for $T$ and $\lambda \in [0, +\infty)$, as required.
\end{proof}

We can use a similar idea for another example to find the essential spectrum of the multiplication operator:

\begin{proposition}
The essential spectrum of the operator $M_f$ on $L^2(0, 1)$, where $M_f u(x) = f(x)u(x)$, is the range of $f$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Similar to before, our initial idea comes from an 'almost-eigenvector'. In this case, if $\lambda$ is in the range
of $f$ with $f(x_0) = \lambda$, we see that $M_f \delta_{x_0} = \lambda \delta_{x_0}$, where $\delta_{x_0}$ is the
Dirac delta centred at $x_0$. Again, $\delta_{x_0}$ is not an eigenfunction of $M_f$ as it is not in the correct domain - this time, 
it isn't even strictly a function (it is a distribution).

Now consider a Friedrichs mollifier $\rho$. This is a function in $C^\infty_0(\mathbb{R})$ with the property that $\sqrt{n}\rho(ny) \rightarrow \delta_0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$; we renormalise it such that $\|\rho\|_2 = 1$, and take the sequence 

$$u_n: x \mapsto 
\begin{cases}
  \sqrt{n}\rho(n(x-x_0)) & x \in (0, 1) \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

thus $u_n$ "converges to $\delta_{x_0}$" in the sense of distributions. Note that $\|u_n\|_2 = \|\rho\|_2 = 1$ for all $n$, and this sequence converges weakly to 0:
\begin{align*}
|( u_n, g )| & = \int_{\supp{u_n}}\sqrt{n}\rho(n(x-x_0))g(x) & \text{\emph{(for any $g \in L^2(0, 1)$)}} \\
& \leq \|u_n\|_2 \sqrt{\int_{\supp{u_n}} |g(x)|^2} & \text{\emph{(by H\"older's inequality)}} \\
& = \sqrt{\int_{\supp{u_n}} |g(x)|^2} \rightarrow 0, \quad \text{as $\supp(u_n)$ decreases to 0.} &
\end{align*}

Then we see $\|(M_f - \lambda)u_n\|_2$ converges to zero by similar reasoning:
\begin{align*}
\|(M_f - \lambda)u_n\|^2_2 & = \int_{\supp \rho_n} |(f(x) - f(x_0) \sqrt{n} \rho(n(x-x_0))|^2 & \text{\emph{(using that $\lambda = f(x_0)$)}} \\
& = \|(f(x) - f(x_0))^2\|_{L^\infty (\supp \rho_n)} \|\rho_n^2\|_1 & \text{\emph{(by H\"older's inequality)}} \\
& = \sup_{x \in \supp \rho_n} \|(f(x) - f(x_0))^2\| \rightarrow 0 & \text{\emph{(note $\|\rho_n^2\|_{L^1} = \|\rho_n\|_2 = 1$)}} \\
\end{align*}
converging to zero as $\supp \rho_n$ shrinks around $x_0$ by the continuity of $f$.

\end{proof}

\subsection{Essential spectrum and compact perturbation}
One interesting property of the essential spectrum that is not easily visible from our earlier definition is that it is invariant under compact
perturbations. This is not the case for eigenvalues!

\begin{definition}{\textbf{(Compact operators and rank)}}\index{operator!compact}\index{rank of an operator}
An operator $T$ on a normed vector space $X$ is \emph{compact} if for every bounded sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $X$, the sequence $(Tx_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ has a convergent subsequence.

The rank of an operator $T$, denoted $\rank T$, is the dimension of its range.
\end{definition}

Note in particular that if a bounded operator $T$ has finite rank, then $T$ is compact; as its image is finite-dimensional and bounded, 
the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem holds for $(Tx_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.

Note also that any compact operator is necessarily bounded, as otherwise we could choose a bounded sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $H$ such that $\|Tx_n\| \rightarrow \infty$, 
and then it would not be possible for $(Tx_n)_{n \rightarrow \infty}$ to have a bounded subsequence. 

\begin{theorem}
Let $\lambda$ be in the essential spectrum of an operator $T$ on a Hilbert space $H$. Then

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:weyl_spectrum}
\lambda \in \bigcap_{K \in \mathcal{K}(H)} \Spec_e(T + K)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{K}(H)$ is the space of all compact linear operators on $H$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First, let $\lambda \in \Spec_e(T)$ have the Weyl sequence $x_n$ for the operator $T$. Then 

$$\|(T+K-\lambda)x_n\| = \|(T - \lambda)x_n+Kx_n\| \leq \|(T - \lambda)x_n\| + \|Kx_n\|$$. 

And as $K$ is compact, $Kx_n$ has a convergent subsequence $Kx_{n_k}$, where $x_{n_k} \rightharpoonup 0$ because $x_n \rightharpoonup 0$.
Then $Kx_{n_k}$ also weakly converges to 0 by two applications of the Riesz representation theorem and the boundedness of $K$: for any $\phi \in H$,

\begin{align*}
(Kx_{n_k}, \phi) & = f(Kx_{n_k}) & \text{\emph{for some bounded linear functional $f \in H^*$}}\\
& = (f \circ K) (x_{n_k}) & \text{\emph{which is also a bounded linear functional in $H^*$}}\\
& = (x_{n_k}, \psi) & \text{\emph{for some $\psi \in H$}}&\\
& \rightarrow 0 & \text{\emph{by weak convergence of $x_{n_k}$ to 0}}
\end{align*}

and as it is (strongly) covergent to some value $K$, it must also be weakly convergent to the same value; thus $Kx_{n_k} \rightarrow 0$.

Thus $\|(T+K-\lambda)x_{n_k}\| \leq \|(T - \lambda)x_{n_k}\| + \|Kx_{n_k}\| \rightarrow 0$, so $x_{n_k}$ is a Weyl sequence for $\lambda$ and $T+K$ 
for any compact operator $K$, so $\lambda \in \bigcap_{K \in \mathcal{K}(H)} \Spec_e(T + K)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
As mentioned before, eigenvalues do not have this property: let $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $T$ with eigenvector $u$, and $P$ the orthogonal 
projection onto the space $\mathrm{span}\{u\}$ (so $\rank P = 1$). Then:

$$(T+P) u = Tu + u = \lambda u + u = (\lambda + 1)u$$

so $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $(T+P)$. This will become a very useful property in discussing a method of detecting spectral pollution known as 
\emph{dissipative barrier methods}, which we will explore in section \ref{sec:dissipative-barrier}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Numerical range and essential numerical range}
\begin{definition}{\textbf{(Numerical range of an operator)}}\index{range!numerical} Let $T$ be an operator on a Hilbert space $H$. The
numerical range $\Num(T)$ is defined

$$\Num(T) = \{( Tu, u ) : u \in \Dom(T), \|u\|=1\}$$

where $\text{Dom}(T)$ is the domain of $T$.
\end{definition}

The numerical range has a variety of interesting properties which make them useful for roughly approximating
the location of spectra.

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:num-range-props}
The numerical range $\Num(T)$ of an operator $T$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem)\label{item:toeplitz-hausdorff}\index{theorem!Toeplitz-Hausdorff} $\Num(T)$ is a convex set;
\item\label{item:num-in-R} $\Num(T) \in \mathbb{R}$ iff $T$ is self-adjoint;
\item\label{item:spec-in-num} $\Spec(T) \subseteq \overline{\Num(T)}$, where $\overline{\Num(T)}$ is the closure of the numerical range of $T$;
\item\label{item:proj-num-range} $\Num(T_\mathcal{L}) \subseteq \Num(T)$, where $T_\mathcal{L}$ is the compression of $T$ to the closed subspace $\mathcal{L}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

It is important to state the usefulness of these properties with regards to spectral pollution. Not only does $\Num(T)$ bound the spectrum of $T$,
it bounds the spectrum of $T_\mathcal{L}$ - effectively, bounding the region in which spectral pollution can occur to a convex set around $\Spec(T)$.

\begin{proof}
(\ref{item:toeplitz-hausdorff}. \cite{gustafson1997numerical}) Take $\lambda = (Tx, x), \mu = (Ty, y) \in \Num(T)$. Define the line segment between them as 
$\nu = t\lambda + (1-t)\mu$ for $t \in [0, 1]$, and $T_\mathcal{L}$ the compression of $T$ to the subspace 
$\mathcal{L} = \text{span}\{x, y\}$. Then we note that $(T_\mathcal{L} x, x) = (Tx, x)$ and $(T_\mathcal{L} y, y) = (Ty, y)$, so $\lambda, \mu$ are in
$\Num(T_\mathcal{L})$. $T_\mathcal{L}$ is two-dimensional, so is a $2 \times 2$ matrix; it can be proven directly (see \cite{gustafson1997numerical}) that the numerical range of a $2 \times 2$ matrix is an ellipse (with foci at both eigenvalues of the matrix!) and so $\nu$ is in $\Num(T_\mathcal{L})$.
Then by property \ref{item:proj-num-range}, $\Num(T_\mathcal{L}) \subseteq \Num(T)$, so $\nu$ is also in $\Num(T)$, as required.

(\ref{item:num-in-R}.) If $T$ is self-adjoint, then $(Tu, u) = (u, Tu)$; by conjugate symmetry of scalar products, $(u, Tu) = \overline{(Tu, u)}$; therefore we combine these to find $(Tu, u) = \overline{(Tu, u)}$ and thus $(Tu, u)$ is real.

(\ref{item:spec-in-num}.) $\overline{\Num(T)}$ is the set of all points $\lambda$ such that there is a sequence of unit vectors $u_n$ where
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}( Tu_n, u_n ) = \lambda.$$

The approximate point spectrum
$\sigma_{ap}(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C}: \text{lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty}\|(T - \lambda)u_n\| \text{ for some sequence } (u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}, \|u_n\| = 1\}$
can be shown to contain the boundary of the spectrum of $T$ (e.g. in Halmos \cite{halmos1982hilbert}, problem 78). Then by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
$|( (T - \lambda)u_n, u_n )| \leq \|(T - \lambda)u_n\| \rightarrow 0$, and so
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
|( (T - \lambda)u_n, u_n )| &  = |( (Tu_n, u_n) ) - ( \lambda u_n, u_n )| \\
& = |( (Tu_n, u_n) ) - \lambda \|u_n\|^2| \\
& = |( (Tu_n, u_n) ) - \lambda| \rightarrow 0; \\
& \implies ( Tu_n, u_n ) \rightarrow \lambda.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Thus the boundary of the spectrum is in $\overline{\Num(T)}$; as the numerical range is convex,
this means the whole spectrum must be.\\

(\ref{item:proj-num-range}.) $\Num(T_\mathcal{L}) = \{( PTPu, u ) : u \in \mathcal{L}, \|u\|=1\}$.
We then use the self-adjointness of $P$ to see
$$( PTPu, u ) = ( TPu, Pu )$$
Then as $u \in \mathcal{L}, \|Pu\| = \|u\| = 1$,
so $( T(Pu), (Pu) ) \in \Num(T)$, and the result follows.

\end{proof}

\subsection{Essential numerical range}\index{range!essential numerical}
A similar notion to that of the numerical range is the essential numerical range, $\Num_e (T)$. This set lowers its aim to simply estimating the essential spectrum,
but in the process manages to do so much more accurately for some operators.

\begin{definition}{\textbf{(Essential numerical range)}} (adapted from \cite{fillmore1972essential})
The essential numerical range of an operator $T$ is given by\footnote{Much like the essential spectrum, there are multiple definitions of the essential numerical range.
However (at least for bounded operators) there is much more equivalence between the definitions than we have for essential spectrum! \cite{fillmore1972essential} We choose the definition with the most
natural relation to our choice of definition for essential spectrum.}

$$\Num_e (T) := \{\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}( Tu_n, u_n ) : (u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\text{ in } \Dom(T), \|u_n\|=1, u_n \rightharpoonup 0.\}$$
\end{definition}
Note the parallels with our definition of the essential spectrum, $\Spec_e(T)$. Indeed, these parallels are reflected in the properties of $\Num_e(T)$:

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:nume-props} The essential numerical range $\Num_e(T)$ of an operator $T$ has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{item:nume-convex} $\Num_e(T)$ is convex;
\item\label{item:nume-in-clos-num} $\Num_e(T) \subseteq \overline{\Num(T)}$;
\item\label{item:nume-is-hull} $\conv(\Spec_e(T)) \subseteq \Num_e(T)$, with equality if $T$ is self-adjoint and bounded.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
(\ref{item:nume-convex}. \cite{bogli2020essential}) We prove this by applying the Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem (Proposition \ref{thm:num-range-props}.\ref{item:toeplitz-hausdorff}) to a sequence. We take $\lambda = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(Tx_n, x_n), \mu = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(Ty_n, y_n) \in \Num_e(T)$
and define a sequence $$\nu_n = t(Tx_n, x_n) + (1-t)(Ty_n, y_n) \quad t \in [0, 1],$$ which obviously converges to $\nu = t\lambda + (1-t)\mu$ as 
$n \rightarrow \infty$.
We then create a sequence of compressions $T_n$, where each compression is to $\text{span}\{x_n, y_n\}$. By the Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem,
we know that $\nu_n$ is in $\Spec(T_n)$ and get a sequence $\nu_n = (Tz_n, z_n)$ converging to $\nu$; the elements $z_n$ are unit vectors in $\text{span}\{x_n, y_n\}$, and they weakly converge to 0 because $x_n$ and $y_n$ both do:
$$(z_n, g) = (\alpha x_n + \beta y_n, g) = \alpha(x_n, g) + \beta(y_n, g) \rightarrow 0 \quad \forall g \in H.$$
This means that $\nu = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(Tz_n, z_n)$ is in $\Spec_e(T)$ as required.

(\ref{item:nume-in-clos-num}.) This can be seen directly from looking at the two definitions. By definition, we have
$$\overline{\Num(T)} = \{lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}( Tu_n, u_n ) : (u_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\text{ in } \Dom(T), \|u_n\|=1\},$$ and $\Num_e(T)$ is the subset of this with the extra condition
that $u_n \rightharpoonup 0$.
\\
(\ref{item:nume-is-hull}.) The inclusion $\Spec_e(T) \subseteq \Num_e(T)$ comes from an analogous argument
to that of Proposition \ref{thm:num-range-props}.\ref{item:spec-in-num}; then $\conv(\Spec_e(T)) \subseteq \Num_e(T)$
by this inclusion and that $\Num_e(T)$ is a convex set.
\end{proof}
It remains to show that $\conv(\Spec_e(T)) = \Num_e(T)$ when $T$ is self-adjoint and bounded. 
This will be proven after the following theorem, which describes another similarity with essential spectra; invariance under compact perturbation.

\begin{theorem}
A value $\lambda$ is in the essential numerical range of an operator $T$ on a Hilbert space $H$ if and only if

$$\lambda \in \bigcap_{K \in \mathcal{K}(H)} \overline{\Num(T+K)}$$

where $\mathcal{K}(H)$ is the set of all compact linear operators on $H$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\lambda = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(Tx_n, x_n)$ be in $\Num_e(T)$. Then $((T+K)x_n, x_n)$ = $(Tx_n, x_n) + (Kx_n, x_n)$ 
which converges to $\lambda$ if $(Kx_n, x_n) \rightarrow 0$, which is true by the weak convergence of $x_n$ (using that $K$ is bounded as it is compact). Thus for any compact operator $K$, 
$\lambda \in \Num_e(T+K) \subseteq \overline{\Num(T+K)}$.

Conversely, %% TODO: finish
\end{proof}

We have seen that the essential numerical range estimates the bounds of the essential spectrum with quite astounding accuracy for some types of
operator. But the essential numerical range far outdoes the regular numerical range on bounding spectral pollution; in fact, it provides an \emph{exact}
set on which it is possible for pollution to occur! 

\begin{theorem}
All spectral pollution in the Ritz approximation of $\Spec(T)$ will be located inside of $\Num_e(T)$; within this set, it can occur anywhere in $\Num_e(T) \setminus \Spec(T)$.
\end{theorem}

For a bounded operator, this is the main result of a paper by Pokrzywa \parencite{pokrzywa1979method}. The main theorem of the paper has the
corollary that for $\lambda \notin \Num_e(T)$, we have $\lambda \in \Spec(T)$ iff $\text{dist}(\lambda, \Spec(T_n)) \rightarrow 0$; that is, outside of the
essential numerical range, every point in the approximate spectrum $\Spec(T_n)$ converges to a point in the actual spectrum of $T$. This is followed by
a lemma which claims that for any sequence $(\lambda_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in the interior of $\Num_e(T)$, there is a sequence of orthogonal projections such that $\lambda_{n-1} \in \Spec(T_n)$ - not only does all spectral pollution occur inside this range, but for \emph{any point} in 
$\Num_e(T) \setminus \Spec(T)$, spectral pollution occurs there in some approximation.
